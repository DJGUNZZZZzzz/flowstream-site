Option C: Working Chat
Why: The chat box looks great but doesn't do anything. Making it functional (type, send, display) will make the Channel Page feel alive.

Option D: Holographic Category Tiles
Why: Pure visual polish. Adding RGB split/glitch on hover will make the categories feel futuristic and fun.

Option E: Loading/Splash Screen
Why: First impressions matter. A "System Boot" animation before the site reveals itself would set the tone immediately.

Which option excites you most? Or if you want, we can tackle them in order (A → B → C, etc.).
