## 🎯 The Opportunity

The live streaming market is projected to reach **$345.1 billion by 2030** (23% CAGR), with **240 million active users on Twitch alone** and **32.5 billion hours watched globally** in 2024. Despite this massive growth, current platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming suffer from critical limitations:

- **Single-stream viewing** - viewers can't watch multiple streams simultaneously
- **Passive consumption** - no educational or skill-building features
- **Limited monetization** - creators struggle to earn sustainable income (Twitch: 50/50 split)
- **High churn rates** - industry average 35-40% annual churn

FLOW STREAMING addresses these pain points with innovative technology that transforms passive viewing into an interactive, educational, and rewarding experience.
